#Decisions about UI (or lack thereof)
Why is the UI of this not changed in any significant way from that of HotCat v2?
One of the main things about HotCat that VE's category editor or the mw.CategoryMultiSelectWidget don't provide is an ability to edit category name rather than merely add or delete categories

HotCat also has the ability to undo removals, among other things.
